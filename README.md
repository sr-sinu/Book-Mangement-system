Assessment Overview
Objective: Evaluate the candidate's proficiency in FastAPI, along with their ability to integrate it with other Python features and external systems. 
Duration: 4-6 hours (to be completed within a day of sharing) 
 Part 1: API Development Task (30% of Total Score)
Build a RESTful API using FastAPI for a hypothetical book review system.
 
Requirements:
1. Endpoints:
   - Add a new book (title, author, publication year).
   - Submit a review for a book (text review, rating).
   - Retrieve all books with an option to filter by author or publication year.
   - Retrieve all reviews for a specific book. 
2. Data Validation: Implement data validation using Pydantic models. 
3. Documentation: Comments. 
4. Error Handling: Implement proper error handling for invalid requests.
 
 Part 2: Integration with Database (20% of Total Score)
Objective: Enhance the API from Part 2 to persist data using a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
 
Requirements:
1. Database Integration: Use SQLite to integrate with a database.
2. CRUD Operations: Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for books and reviews.
3. Data Modeling: Design database schema appropriate for the book review system.
 
 Part 3: Advanced Features and Testing (20% of Total Score)
1. Background Task: Implement a background task for sending a confirmation email (simulated) after a review is posted.
2. Testing: Write tests for the API endpoints using FastAPI's test client.

 Part 4: Theoretical Questions (30% of Total Score)
•	- Question 1: Explain how FastAPI handles asynchronous requests and its benefits over synchronous code in Python.
•	- Question 2: Describe how dependency injection works in FastAPI and give an example of its practical use.
•	- Question 3: Code walkthrough

 
 Evaluation Criteria
•	- Code Quality: Readability, use of Pythonic idioms.
•	- Functionality: How well the API meets the specified requirements.
•	- Error Handling and Robustness: Graceful handling of edge cases and invalid inputs.
•	- Testing: Coverage and effectiveness of tests.
•	- Documentation: Clarity and completeness of the API documentation.
 
 Submission Instructions
Candidates should submit a link to a GitHub repository containing:
•	- Source code.
•	- README file with setup and usage instructions.
•	- Any other necessary documentation.
 
This assessment will allow us to gauge the candidate's proficiency in FastAPI, their understanding of RESTful API principles, database integration, and their general coding skills and practices.
